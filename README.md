The C programming language has spurred many language developments 

The C programming language has spurred many language developments since its invention by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s. Many modern programming languages owe their syntax to C: learning C first makes learning other languages such as Java, php, and Swift much easier. C is still a very popular programming language after over 40 years

In this course, we'll explore the C programming language in a different way than is usually taught. We'll start with data types (of course), then quickly dispel the mystery (and fright) that surrounds C's most powerful element, the pointer. Understanding pointers first allows us to grasp the underlying nature of arrays and structs, parameters passed by reference, and many other things hidden by other languages but exposed in C.

The course contains five units that teach the foundations of C. Here's what you'll learn:

- Data types and operators

- Pointers and arrays

- Input and output

- Command line arguments

- Decisions and loops

- Functions

- Value and reference parameter passing

- Structures

- The stack vs. the heap, and dynamic allocation

- Working with linked lists

So why wait pal?
